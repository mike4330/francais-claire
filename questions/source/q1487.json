  "explanation": "The text states '<em>Cette lettre a été laissée sur votre bureau ce matin</em>' - This letter was left on your desk this morning. The French sentence uses 'laissée' - the past participle feminine form of 'laisser' (to leave). The past participle agrees with the feminine noun 'lettre' in the passive voice construction.",
