    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Honnêtement, ce consultant financier n'a pas donné les bons conseils à mes clients</em>' - Honestly, this financial consultant didn't give good advice to my clients. 'Honnêtement' means 'honestly' or 'frankly'. The distractors test misinterpretation of the speaker's opinion (was very honest, charged too much, needs more time).",
