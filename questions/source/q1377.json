    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Si vous changez pis votre approche, les résultats seront meilleurs</em>' - If you change your approach for the worse, the results will be better. This is paradoxical advice suggesting that even making things worse can lead to improvement. 'Pis' means 'worse' and 'changez' is the second person plural form of 'changer'.",
