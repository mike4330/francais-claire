  "question": "What is the difference between what Marie knows and what she believes?",
  "questionType": "comprehension",
  "options": [
    "She knows she speaks three languages and believes it's not sufficient",
    "She believes she speaks three languages and knows she should study more",
    "She knows three languages aren't enough and believes she should quit",
    "She believes everything and knows nothing for certain"
  ],
  "correct": 0,
  "explanation": "Marie uses 'Je sais parler trois langues' (I know how to speak three languages) to state a definite fact. She uses 'je ne crois pas que ce soit suffisant' (I don't believe it's sufficient) and 'Je crois qu'il vaut mieux continuer' (I believe it's better to continue) for her opinions and judgments. The correct answer captures this distinction: she KNOWS her language ability and BELIEVES her assessment of its adequacy.",
