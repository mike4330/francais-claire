        "Because of the double accusation brought by the judge",

    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Il perdrait sûrement ce procès à cause de la double accusation portée par le juge</em>' - He would surely lose this trial because of the double accusation brought by the judge. 'Perdrait' is the third-person singular conditional of 'perdre' (to lose), and 'double' means 'double'. The distractors test misinterpretation of the reason (lawyer lacks experience, evidence overwhelming, jury biased).",
