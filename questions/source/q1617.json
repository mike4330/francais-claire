    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Il a échoué à l'examen, pourtant il avait beaucoup étudié pour se préparer.</em>' - He failed the exam, yet he had studied a lot to prepare for it. 'Pourtant' means 'however' or 'yet' and introduces a contrast. The distractors test misinterpretation of study habits (didn't study at all), misinterpretation of expectations (expecting to fail), and misinterpretation of the exam itself (took the wrong exam).",
