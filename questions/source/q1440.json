    "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Near your leg to change the timber of your voice during recording'. The text states '<em>Tu tiendras le microphone près de ta jambe pour modifier le timbre de ta voix pendant l'enregistrement</em>' - You will hold the microphone near your leg to modify the timber of your voice during recording. 'Tiendras' is the future form of 'tenir' (to hold), 'jambe' means 'leg', and 'voix' means 'voice'.",
