  "explanation": "The text states '<em>En croyant fermement cela, elle ne vit pas que son oeil gauche commençait à présenter des signes d'irritation inquiétants</em>' - While firmly believing that, she didn't see that her left eye was beginning to show worrying signs of irritation. 'Croyant' is the present participle of croire (to believe), 'cela' means that (formal), and 'oeil' means eye.",
