  "explanation": "The text states '<em>S'il avait plus d'argent, il irait en vacances en Italie</em>' - If he had more money, he would go on vacation to Italy. 'Irait' is the conditional form of 'aller' (to go), expressing a hypothetical action. The distractors test misinterpretation of the hypothetical action (buy a new car, move to a bigger apartment, start his own business).",
