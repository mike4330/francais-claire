    "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Because of the double accusation brought by the judge'. The text states '<em>Il perdrait sûrement ce procès à cause de la double accusation portée par le juge</em>' - He would surely lose this trial because of the double accusation brought by the judge. 'Perdrait' is the third-person singular conditional of 'perdre' (to lose), and 'double' means 'double'.",
