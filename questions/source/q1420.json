The text states '<em>Les syndicats croient que les négociations aideront le peuple travailleur à obtenir de meilleures conditions de travail</em>' - The unions believe that the negotiations will help working people get better working conditions. 'Aideront' is the future tense of 'aider' (to help), 'peuple' means 'people', and 'travailleur' means 'working/worker'.",
