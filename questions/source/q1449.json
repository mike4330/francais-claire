    "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Obscurely without revealing your true intentions to shareholders'. The text states '<em>Vous travailliez obscurément sur les questions de gouvernance d'entreprise sans révéler vos véritables intentions aux actionnaires</em>' - You were working obscurely on corporate governance issues without revealing your true intentions to shareholders. 'Travailliez' is the second-person plural imperfect of 'travailler' (to work), and 'obscurément' means 'obscurely'.",
