The text states '<em>Selon l'annonce officielle, chercher un nouveau boulot deviendrait plus facile avec la nouvelle plateforme numérique</em>' - According to the official announcement, looking for a new job would become easier with the new digital platform. 'Deviendrait' is the conditional form of 'devenir' (to become), and 'boulot' is informal for 'job'. The distractors test confusion about what would become easier.",
