    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Ferme la porte doucement, le bébé dort dans la chambre</em>' - Close the door gently, the baby is sleeping in the room. 'Doucement' means 'gently' or 'softly'. The distractors test misinterpretation of the reason (door broken, neighbors nearby, late at night).",
