  "explanation": "The text states '<em>Mes parents pouvaient toujours m'emmener au parc le dimanche à l'époque où j'étais petit</em>' - My parents could always take me to the park on Sundays back when I was little. 'Pouvaient' is the imperfect of 'pouvoir' (could/were able to), with the temporal clause repositioned at the end. The distractors test misinterpretation of the nuance of 'pouvaient' (would, had to, wanted to).",
