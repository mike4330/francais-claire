    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Technically'. The text states '<em>L'ingénieur apprendra techniquement ces opérations de maintenance préventive pour optimiser les systèmes industriels complexes</em>' - The engineer will learn these preventive maintenance operations technically to optimize complex industrial systems. 'Apprendra' is the third-person singular future of 'apprendre' (to learn), and 'techniquement' means 'technically'.",
