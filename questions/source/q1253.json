    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Quand il rentra du bureau, il demanda à sa femme si elle avait entendu les nouvelles horribles concernant leur oncle</em>' - When he returned from the office, he asked his wife if she had heard the horrible news about their uncle. This combines 'rentra' (returned), 'demanda' (asked), and references hearing, plus includes vocabulary gaps like 'horribles' and 'oncle'.",
