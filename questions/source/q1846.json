    "explanation": "The speaker said 'En parlant de voyage, nous devrions organiser nos prochaines vacances' - Speaking of travel, we should organize our next vacation. 'Parlant' is the present participle of 'parler' (to speak/talk), used in the expression 'en parlant de' (speaking of). The distractors test confusion about the suggestion.",
