    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Tu as envoyé ce con faire ses courses quotidiennes au supermarché</em>' - You sent this idiot to do their daily errands at the supermarket. 'Envoyé' is the past participle of 'envoyer' (to send), 'con' is a colloquial term meaning 'idiot', and 'courses quotidiennes' means 'daily errands'. The distractors test misinterpretation of the person described (helpful neighbor, professional delivery service representative, responsible teenage child).",
