The text states '<em>La dame âgée avait tenue sa ferme de poulets pendant cinquante années avant de la vendre</em>' - The elderly lady had kept her chicken farm for fifty years before selling it. 'Tenue' is the past participle of 'tenir' (to keep/hold), 'dame' means 'lady', and 'poulets' means 'chickens'.",
