    "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Important conclusions'. The text states '<em>Je tirerai des conclusions importantes de cette vue d'ensemble sur les expositions d'art contemporain</em>' - I will draw important conclusions from this overview of contemporary art exhibitions. 'Tirerai' is the future form of 'tirer' (to draw/pull), and 'vue' means 'view/sight'. The distractors test confusion about what will be drawn from the overview.",
