The text states '<em>Mon collègue boit techniquement cette boisson pour respecter ses obligations contractuelles professionnelles</em>' - My colleague drinks this beverage technically to respect his professional contractual obligations. 'Boit' is the third-person singular present of 'boire' (to drink), and 'techniquement' means 'technically'.",
