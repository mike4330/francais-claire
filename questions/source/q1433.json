    "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Sell their horse because all savings are lost'. The text states '<em>Après cette série de malchances, toutes mes économies sont perdues et je dois vendre mon cheval</em>' - After this series of bad luck, all my savings are lost and I have to sell my horse. 'Perdues' is the feminine past participle of 'perdre' (to lose), and 'cheval' means 'horse'.",
