    "explanation": "The text states '<em>La carotte claire et la laitue pareille restent drôles dans ce ragoût faux.</em>' - The light carrot and similar lettuce remain funny in this fake stew. The nouns 'carotte' means carrot, 'laitue' means lettuce, and 'ragoût' means stew. The adjectives 'claire' means light/clear, 'pareille' means similar, 'drôles' means funny, and 'faux' means fake. The distractors test misinterpretation of ingredients (expensive vegetables), misinterpretation of cooking elements (traditional recipe), and misinterpretation of preparation (cooking method).",
