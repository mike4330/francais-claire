    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Tu n'oublieras aucunement cette décision idiote que tu as prise hier soir</em>' - You will not forget at all this stupid decision that you made last night. 'Aucunement' means 'not at all/in no way', 'oublieras' is the future tense of 'oublier' (to forget), and 'idiote' (stupid) agrees with the feminine noun 'décision'. The distractors test misinterpretation of the type of decision or timing (smart choice, brilliant idea, careful plan).",
