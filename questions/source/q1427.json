The text states '<em>Si j'étais avocat, je deviendrais spécialiste du système judiciaire pour sortir les innocents de prison</em>' - If I were a lawyer, I would become a specialist in the judicial system to get innocent people out of prison. 'Deviendrais' is the conditional form of 'devenir' (to become), and 'prison' means 'prison'.",
