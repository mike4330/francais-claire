    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Cette patiente dormira avec son épaule pure contre le mur pour analyser ses expressions faciales pendant le sommeil paradoxal</em>' - This patient will sleep with her pure shoulder against the wall to analyze her facial expressions during REM sleep. 'Dormira' is the third-person singular future of 'dormir' (to sleep), 'épaule' means 'shoulder', and 'pure' means 'pure'. The distractors test misinterpretation of the method (using specialized monitoring equipment, in a controlled environment, following strict positioning protocols).",
