  "explanation": "The text states '<em>Ma grand-mère jouait du piano tous les dimanches après-midi quand j'étais petit</em>' - My grandmother played the piano every Sunday afternoon when I was little. 'Jouait' is the imperfect form of 'jouer' (to play), describing a past habit with the temporal clause repositioned. The distractors test confusion about the grandmother's activity.",
