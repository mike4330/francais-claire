    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is 'The naval maneuvers finished earlier than expected'. The text states '<em>Au contraire de nos attentes, les manœuvres navales sont finies plus tôt que prévu</em>' - Contrary to our expectations, the naval maneuvers are finished earlier than expected. 'Contraire' means 'contrary', 'finies' is the past participle of 'finir' (to finish), and 'navales' refers to naval operations.",
