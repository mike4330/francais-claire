The text states '<em>Il faut que tu deviennes plus patient avec ce fardeau lourd pendant le processus de guérison naturelle</em>' - You must become more patient with this heavy burden during the natural healing process. 'Deviennes' is the second-person singular subjunctive of 'devenir' (to become), and 'lourd' means 'heavy'.",
