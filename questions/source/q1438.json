    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is 'The speaker became tired and their vision got blurry'. The text states '<em>Plus la durée du spectacle s'allongeait, plus je devenais fatigué et ma vue se troublait</em>' - The longer the duration of the show got, the more tired I became and my vision got blurry. 'Devenais' is the imperfect form of 'devenir' (to become), and 'vue' means 'vision/sight'.",
