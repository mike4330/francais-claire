  "explanation": "The text states '<em>Que feriez-vous si vous aviez plus de temps libre ?</em>' - What would you do if you had more free time? It uses 'feriez' - the conditional form of 'faire' (to do/make) for vous. 'Que feriez-vous si...' means 'what would you do if...'. This is a hypothetical conditional question structure.",
