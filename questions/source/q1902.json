    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Il retire furieusement son chapeau en montant les escaliers, car le prix égal pour tous les spectateurs l'irrite profondément</em>' - He furiously removes his hat while going up the stairs, because the equal price for all spectators deeply irritates him. 'Chapeau' means hat, 'furieusement' means furiously, 'égal' means equal, and 'montant' is the present participle of 'monter'.",
