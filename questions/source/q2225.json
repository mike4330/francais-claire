  "explanation": "The text states '<em>Le boxeur frappé vachement fort s'est relevé courageusement pour continuer le combat malgré sa douleur visible.</em>' - The boxer hit really hard got up courageously to continue the fight despite his visible pain. 'Frappé' is the past participle of 'frapper' (to hit), and 'vachement' means 'really' or 'very' (informal).",
