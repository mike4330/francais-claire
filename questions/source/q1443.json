The text states '<em>Son talent artistique tombera horriblement si elle ne pratique pas régulièrement son instrument de musique</em>' - Her artistic talent will fall horribly if she doesn't practice her musical instrument regularly. 'Tombera' is the future form of 'tomber' (to fall), and 'horriblement' means 'horribly'.",
