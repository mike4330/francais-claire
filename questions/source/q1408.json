    "explanation": "The correct answer is 'The stupid decision you made last night'. The text states '<em>Tu n'oublieras aucunement cette décision idiote que tu as prise hier soir</em>' - You will not forget at all this stupid decision that you made last night. 'Aucunement' means 'not at all/in no way', 'oublieras' is the future tense of 'oublier' (to forget), and 'idiote' (stupid) agrees with the feminine noun 'décision'.",
