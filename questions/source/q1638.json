    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Il pointe son doigt vers elle et lui dit de fermer sa gueule immédiatement</em>' - He points his finger at her and tells her to shut her mouth immediately. This targets the nouns 'doigt' and 'gueule' in a confrontational context. Note: 'gueule' is vulgar slang for mouth. The distractors test misinterpretation of the command (listen more carefully, speak more clearly, repeat what she said).",
