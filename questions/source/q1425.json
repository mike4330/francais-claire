    "explanation": "The correct answer is 'He told me about his extraordinary maritime adventures'. The text states '<em>Quand j'aidais le capitaine pendant le déjeuner, il me racontait ses aventures maritimes extraordinaires</em>' - When I was helping the captain during lunch, he was telling me about his extraordinary maritime adventures. 'Aidais' is the imperfect form of 'aider' (to help), and 'capitaine' means 'captain'.",
