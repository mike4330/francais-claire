    "questionType": "comprehension",
    "options": [
        "Their soul and spirituality in that dark place",

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Their soul and spirituality in that dark place'. The text states '<em>Si je vais en prison, je perdrai certainement mon âme et ma spiritualité dans ce lieu sombre</em>' - If I go to prison, I will certainly lose my soul and my spirituality in that dark place. 'Perdrai' is the future tense of 'perdre' (to lose), 'prison' means 'prison', and 'âme' means 'soul'.",
