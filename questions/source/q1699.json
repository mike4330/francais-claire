    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Elle trouvait que le nouveau système de transport public était beaucoup plus efficace</em>' - She found that the new public transport system was much more efficient. 'Trouvait' is the imperfect tense of 'trouver' (to find/think), expressing a past opinion or judgment. The distractors test misinterpretation of her opinion (too expensive, poorly designed, unnecessarily complex).",
