    "explanation": "The French sentence states '<em>Elle regardera le film ce soir</em>' - She will watch the movie tonight. 'Regardera' is the future form of 'regarder' (to watch) for il/elle. 'Ce soir' means 'tonight' or 'this evening'. The distractors test misinterpretation of the time (yesterday, this morning, next week).",
