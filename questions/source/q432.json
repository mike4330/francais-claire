  "correct": 0,
  "explanation": "The text states '<em>La lune brille dans le ciel nocturne.</em>' - The moon shines in the night sky. This introduces basic astronomy vocabulary: 'lune' (moon), 'brille' (shines), 'ciel' (sky), and 'nocturne' (night/nighttime). The distractors test misinterpretation of the moon's state or appearance (hiding behind clouds, very far from Earth, appears during the day).",
