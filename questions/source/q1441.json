    "explanation": "The correct answer is 'They fall incredibly fast'. The text states '<em>Ces légumes biologiques tombent sacrément vite quand ils sont trop mûrs pour la vente</em>' - These organic vegetables fall incredibly fast when they are too ripe for sale. 'Tombent' is the third-person plural present of 'tomber' (to fall), and 'sacrément' is an intensifying adverb meaning 'incredibly/really'.",
