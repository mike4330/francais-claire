        "They were opened separately to facilitate the investigation",

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is 'They were opened separately to facilitate the investigation'. The text states '<em>Les bureaux sont maintenant ouverts et les dossiers ont été ouverts séparément pour faciliter l'enquête</em>' - The offices are now open and the files have been opened separately to facilitate the investigation. 'Ouvert' means 'open', 'ouverts' is the past participle agreeing with 'dossiers' (files), and 'séparément' means 'separately'.",
