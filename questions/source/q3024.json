  "explanation": "The text states '<em>Je croirai, pis encore, que ce nom prestigieux dissimule délibérément les véritables intentions politiques et économiques</em>' - I will believe, worse still, that this prestigious name deliberately conceals the true political and economic intentions. 'Croirai' is the future tense of croire (to believe), 'pis' means worse, and 'nom' means name.",
