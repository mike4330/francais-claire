    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Il tiendra naturellement sa promesse même si cela semble impossible à réaliser maintenant</em>' - He will naturally keep his promise even if it seems impossible to achieve now. 'Tiendra' is the future form of 'tenir' (to hold/keep), 'naturellement' means 'naturally', and 'impossible' describes the apparent difficulty.",
