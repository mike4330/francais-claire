  "explanation": "The missing word is 'devait'. The complete sentence is '<em>Le concert devait commencer à 20h mais il y a un retard technique</em>' - The concert was supposed to start at 8 PM but there's a technical delay. 'Devait' is the imperfect form of 'devoir' (must/should), third person singular, expressing an obligation or expectation that was interrupted.",
