    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Les habitants vivaient au bout de la forêt verte, totalement isolés de la ville polluée</em>' - The inhabitants lived at the edge of the green forest, totally isolated from the polluted city. 'Vivaient' is imperfect tense, 'bout' means end/edge, 'verte' means green, and 'totalement' means totally. The distractors test confusion about the inhabitants' relationship with the city.",
