        "She suffers enormously since the murder and can no longer eat on an empty stomach in the morning",

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Elle souffre énormément depuis son meurtre et ne peut plus manger à jeun le matin</em>' - She suffers enormously since the murder and can no longer eat on an empty stomach in the morning. 'Souffre' is third person singular present of 'souffrir' (to suffer), with missing noun 'meurtre' (murder) and adverb 'à jeun' (on an empty stomach).",
