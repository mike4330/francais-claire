  "explanation": "The text states '<em>Nous sommes tombés d'accord sur les termes du contrat</em>' - We agreed on the contract terms. 'Tomber d'accord' is a French idiom meaning 'to come to an agreement' or 'to agree'. The past participle 'tombés' agrees with the subject 'nous' in the passé composé, and 'termes' means 'terms' or 'conditions'.",
