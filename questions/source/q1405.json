    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Sa peau pâle a changé dangereusement après l'exposition prolongée au soleil intense hier</em>' - Her pale skin dangerously changed after prolonged exposure to intense sun yesterday. 'Pâle' means 'pale', 'a changé' is the past compound form of 'changer' (to change), and 'dangereusement' means 'dangerously'.",
