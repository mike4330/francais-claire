    "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Alertly, on the lookout in the valley this morning'. The text states '<em>Nous écoutons aux aguets les mouvements de l'armée ennemie dans la vallée ce matin</em>' - We are listening alertly to the movements of the enemy army in the valley this morning. 'Écoutons' is the first-person plural present of 'écouter' (to listen), 'aux aguets' means 'on the lookout/alert', and 'armée' means 'army'.",
