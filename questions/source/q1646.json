    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Quoi? Ces règlements changent bizarrement chaque mois au bureau</em>' - What? These regulations change oddly every month at the office. 'Quoi' expresses surprise, 'bizarrement' means 'oddly/strangely'. The distractors test misinterpretation of what is changing (meetings, deadlines, schedules) and the frequency (every week, every quarter, every day).",
