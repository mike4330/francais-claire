  "questionType": "comprehension",
  "options": [
    "The majority party and former allies are working together in opposition",

    "Former allies have convinced the majority party to abandon opposition",
    "Both groups oppose any opposition stance"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "explanation": "The text states '<em>Le parti majoritaire renoue avec l'opposition, mais pas avec ses anciens alliés</em>' - The majority party reconnects with opposition, but not with its former allies. The quote suggests moderates have 'returned home' (to opposition politics) but haven't forgiven their former allies' role in allowing 'the worst reforms in years' to pass.",
