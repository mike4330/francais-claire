    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Cette maison proche et grise ?</em>' - This nearby gray house? The adjectives 'proche' (nearby/close) and 'grise' (gray, feminine form of 'gris') describe the house. The distractors test misinterpretation of location (far, distant) and color (black, white).",
