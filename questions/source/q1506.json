    "explanation": "The correct answer is 'Train departure announcements'. The text states '<em>Vous écoutiez attentivement les annonces de départ des trains pendant que nous attendions sur le quai</em>' - You were listening attentively to train departure announcements while we waited on the platform. 'Écoutiez' is the second-person plural imperfect of 'écouter' (to listen), and 'départ' means 'departure'.",
