    "explanation": "The text states '<em>Je ne croyais pas que vous croyiez carrément que cette terre appartenait à votre famille depuis toujours</em>' - I didn't believe that you really believed that this land belonged to your family forever. 'Croyiez' is the imperfect subjunctive of croire (to believe), 'carrément' means really/completely, and 'terre' means land/earth.",
