  "explanation": "The text states '<em>Mettons que nous ayons un problème, comment le résoudrions-nous?</em>' - Let's say we have a problem, how would we solve it? 'Mettons que' introduces a hypothetical situation using the subjunctive mood. The correct answer is 'They should imagine a problem and how to solve it' because 'mettons que' means 'let's suppose/imagine that'.",
