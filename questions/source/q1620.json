  "question": "What approach do modern romantic relationships take regarding emotional expression?",
  "questionType": "comprehension",
  "options": [
    "You often let your partners express their emotions without judgment, promoting authentic and respectful communication",
    "You should control your partners' emotional expressions to maintain relationship stability",
    "You typically discourage emotional expression to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings",
    "You focus primarily on logical discussions rather than emotional communication"
  ],
  "correct": 0,
  "explanation": "The text states 'vous laissez souvent vos partenaires exprimer leurs émotions sans jugement, favorisant ainsi une communication authentique et respectueuse' - you often let your partners express their emotions without judgment, promoting authentic and respectful communication. 'Laissez' is the second person plural form of 'laisser' (to let/allow), demonstrating this crucial relationship conjugate. This introduces 'porte' context (opening doors to communication).",
