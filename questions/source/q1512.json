    "explanation": "The correct answer is 'If mathematical logic didn't work correctly in this context'. The text states '<em>Je changerais cette approche ferme si la logique mathématique ne fonctionnait pas correctement dans ce contexte</em>' - I would change this firm approach if mathematical logic didn't work correctly in this context. 'Changerais' is the first-person singular conditional of 'changer' (to change), and 'ferme' means 'firm'.",
