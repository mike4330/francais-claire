The text states '<em>Dans l'armée, vous teniez à maintenir vos routines de soins personnels malgré les conditions difficiles sur le terrain</em>' - In the army, you insisted on maintaining your personal care routines despite difficult field conditions. 'Teniez' is the second-person plural imperfect of 'tenir' (to hold/insist), and 'armée' means 'army'.",
