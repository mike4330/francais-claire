# üá´üá∑ French Listening Practice App

A sophisticated French news listening training system designed to bridge the gap between high school French and understanding authentic French media. Features professional-quality audio synthesis, difficulty-graded content, and intelligent caching for scalable learning.

## üéØ Objective

**Primary Goal**: A "software toy" for French language learning - an endless, exploratory learning experience without artificial endpoints or completion states. Like SimCity for language acquisition, this app provides continuous discovery and growth through authentic French media content.

**Software Toy Philosophy**: 
- **No "End" State**: Learning continues indefinitely with ever-evolving content
- **Exploratory Learning**: Users discover language through authentic contexts
- **Continuous Content Evolution**: New questions, topics, and variations added regularly
- **Organic Growth**: Content expands based on user needs and linguistic gaps
- **Playful Engagement**: Learning feels like exploration rather than curriculum completion

**Target Focus**: 
- **A2-C2 levels** (A1 content minimal - focus is on media literacy, not basic language acquisition)
- **Authentic vocabulary** from French journalism, politics, and current affairs
- **Real-world contexts** encountered in French media consumption
- **Progressive difficulty** to build from elementary understanding to full media comprehension
- **Living Content**: Questions and vocabulary that evolve with contemporary French usage

This app bridges the gap between classroom French and the linguistic reality of French news media, preparing learners for genuine French content consumption through endless, engaging exploration.

- **Auto-advance**: 1.5s advancement on correct answers
- **Skip Questions**: Skip difficult questions with separate scoring
- **Answer Randomization**: Fisher-Yates shuffle prevents pattern memorization
- **Settings Persistence**: localStorage for user preferences

### üéØ Intelligent Question Selection
The app uses a revolutionary **pure intelligent selection** system that eliminates traditional question sequences in favor of adaptive, performance-driven question delivery.

#### **Pure Intelligent Selection Architecture** (July 2025 Redesign)

**Key Innovation**: Every question request goes through intelligent selection - no more filtered arrays or sequential navigation.

**How It Works**:
- **No Question Arrays**: Removed the problematic `questions` array filtering system
- **Direct ID-based Loading**: `loadQuestion(questionId)` finds questions directly in `questionBank`
- **Every Question Optimized**: Each question request uses `findBestQuestionForLevel()` 
- **No Sequence Dependency**: Questions selected purely on learning objectives and performance

#### **Two UI Paths for Intelligent Selection**

**Path 1: Main Page Level Buttons** (`french_listening_app.html`)
- **Trigger**: User clicks difficulty level buttons (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2)
- **Process**: Asynchronously loads performance data via WebSocket, then applies intelligent selection
- **Flow**: `selectDifficulty()` ‚Üí `loadUserPerformanceDataThenStart()` ‚Üí `findBestQuestionForLevel()`

**Path 2: Student Dashboard Level Cards** (`student.html`)
- **Trigger**: User clicks pre-calculated level progress cards  
- **Process**: Performance data already loaded, best question pre-calculated during card rendering
- **Flow**: `launchQuizWithLevel()` ‚Üí redirects to main app with `?start={questionId}`

#### **3-Tier Priority Algorithm** (Used by Both Paths)
1. **Priority 1 - New Learning**: Selects unattempted questions (lowest ID first)
   - Reasoning: "Student has never attempted this question - perfect for new learning"

2. **Priority 2 - Targeted Practice**: Focuses on questions with <70% success rate
   - Sorts by lowest success rate first, then by question ID
   - Reasoning: "Student struggling with this question - targeted practice needed"

3. **Priority 3 - Mastery Review**: When all questions are mastered (‚â•70% success)
   - Returns lowest ID for spaced repetition review
   - Reasoning: "Maintaining mastery through spaced repetition"

#### **Performance Tracking with Timestamps**
- **`lastAnswered` Field**: Every performance record includes when question was last answered
- **Time-Aware Debug Logs**: Console shows "Question 403 last answered 2 days 3 hours ago"
- **Anti-Repetition Logic**: Uses timestamps to avoid recently answered questions
- **Future-Ready**: Enables spaced repetition and forgetting curve algorithms

#### **Technical Implementation**
- **Performance Data Source**: Redis WebSocket connection with real-time user statistics
- **Data Structure**: `questionPerformances` array with success rates, attempt counts, timestamps
- **Direct Question Loading**: `loadQuestion(questionId)` bypasses array indexing entirely
- **Dynamic User Answers**: `userAnswers.push()` tracks questions by ID, not array position
- **Async Loading**: WebSocket retry logic for connection delays
- **Debug Visibility**: Comprehensive console logging for selection process and timing

#### **Major Architectural Changes** (July 2025)
- **üö´ Removed Question Filtering**: Eliminated `filterQuestionsByDifficulty()` and `questions[]` array
- **üö´ Removed Sequential Navigation**: No more `currentQuestion` index or `nextQuestionSequential()`
- **‚úÖ Pure Intelligent Selection**: Every question request uses performance-driven algorithms
- **‚úÖ ID-Based Architecture**: Questions loaded directly by ID from `questionBank`
- **‚úÖ Timestamp Tracking**: Added `lastAnswered` field to performance data
- **‚úÖ Simplified Flow**: Removed 100+ lines of array management code
- **‚úÖ Enhanced Debugging**: Time-aware console logs for question selection analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Software Toy Architecture for Continuous Content Creation

The "software toy" approach drives all development decisions, prioritizing endless content evolution over traditional feature completion:

#### Content-First Development
- **Continuous Addition**: New questions, vocabulary, and contexts added regularly
- **Living Vocabulary**: Content adapts to contemporary French usage and current events
- **Gap Analysis**: Tools identify linguistic gaps for targeted content creation
- **Organic Growth**: Content expands based on learner discovery patterns

#### Adding New Questions
The process for adding new questions involves providing French text to the assistant. The assistant will then:
1. **Classify the Text**: Determine the CEFR difficulty level based on word count and content complexity.
2. **Generate Questions**: Create both comprehension (English) and listening (French) question types with appropriate options, correct answers, and explanations.
3. **Populate Fields**: Fill in all necessary fields such as `id`, `audioText`, `question`, `questionType`, `options`, `correct`, `explanation`, `difficulty`, `source`, and `tags`.
4. **Insert into File**: Place the new questions into the appropriate question file (e.g., `questions-a.json`, `questions-b.json`, or `questions-c.json`) based on difficulty or content category, ensuring unique IDs and logical organization.

This method ensures that new content is seamlessly integrated into the existing question bank with minimal manual intervention.

#### Content Evolution Tools
- **`lemma-coverage.py`**: Unified analysis tool for identifying vocabulary gaps across adjectives, adverbs, verbs, and nouns
- **Template System**: Semantic variations prevent stagnation and enable exponential content growth
- **Tag Analysis**: Content discovery through thematic clustering
- **Performance Analytics**: User data drives content prioritization

### Template Question Creation
```javascript
// Template-enabled question
addQuestion({
  audioText: "Fallback text",
  audioTemplate: "Une {subject} a {verb} que...",
  templateVariables: {
    "subject": {
      "options": ["femme", "d√©put√©e", "ministre"],
      "weights": [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]
    },
    "verb": {
      "options": ["dit", "d√©clar√©", "affirm√©"],
      "weights": [0.4, 0.3, 0.3]
    }
  },
  // ... other fields
});
```

### Cache Operations
```javascript
// Evict specific question from cache
evictQuestionFromCache(questionId);

// Get cache statistics
updateCacheStats();

// Clear all template variations
regenerateVariations();
```

## üìà Performance

### Optimizations
- **Parallel Tool Calls**: Multiple operations execute simultaneously
- **WebSocket Caching**: Sub-second cache lookups
- **Audio Compression**: Efficient MP3 storage
- **Smart Pre-loading**: Cache commonly accessed content

### Scalability
- **Unlimited Audio Storage**: Redis-based caching system
- **Template System**: Exponential content variation (e.g., 1,024 combinations from 5 variables)
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend with new question types

## üéì Educational Philosophy
