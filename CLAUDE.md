## üö® CRITICAL: Tag Content Policy

**TAGS MUST DESCRIBE REAL-WORLD CONTENT TOPICS ONLY**

‚ùå **NEVER use these as tags:**
- Grammar terms (listening, conditional, imperfect, subjunctive)
- Verb names (aller, √™tre, avoir, faire, dire, voir, parler, aimer)  
- Individual French words (peu, s√ªr, beau, seul, heureux, pauvre)
- Language mechanics (gender-agreement, exact-comprehension, tense-forms)

‚úÖ **ALWAYS use these instead:**
- Real situations (restaurant, workplace, family, travel, news)
- Content themes (politics, technology, health, education, business)
- Context types (formal-discussion, casual-conversation, media-coverage)

**Think: "What real-world situation is this question about?" NOT "What grammar does it test?"**


## üö® CRITICAL: Question File Organization

**NEW QUESTIONS**: Add to individual `questions/source/q{ID}.json` files ‚Üí Compile with `node compile-questions.js`

**File Structure**:
- **Compiled A**: A1 & A2 levels (ID: 1-199) ‚Üí `questions/q-compiled-a.json`
- **Compiled B**: B1 & B2 levels (ID: 200-399) ‚Üí `questions/q-compiled-b.json`  
- **Compiled C**: C1 & C2 levels (ID: 400-510) ‚Üí `questions/q-compiled-c.json`

## üéØ Strategic Question Creation

**Before adding questions, use data-driven analysis to identify the highest-priority vocabulary gaps.**

### Running Lemma Coverage Analysis

Use the comprehensive lemma analysis tool to identify coverage gaps:

```bash
cd util
python3 lemma-coverage.py --limit 20
```

**Target high-frequency lemmas with low coverage. Create questions addressing multiple gaps simultaneously.**



## üìã Adding New Questions

**üîÑ CORRECT SEQUENCE: Analyze ‚Üí Generate ‚Üí Classify ‚Üí Pick ID ‚Üí Write**

### Step 1: Generate Content & Question Type
- Create French `audioText` with target vocabulary/grammar
- Design appropriate question and 4 plausible options
- Choose question type: comprehension, listening, fill-in-the-blank, FIB-reading

### Step 2: Classify Difficulty Level
- Count words in `audioText` to determine CEFR level:
  - **A1 Beginner** (max 9 words) ‚Üí `questions-a.json`
  - **A2 Elementary** (max 14 words) ‚Üí `questions-a.json`
  - **B1 Intermediate** (max 25 words) ‚Üí `questions-b.json`
  - **B2 Upper-Intermediate** (max 38 words) ‚Üí `questions-b.json`
  - **C1 Advanced** (max 60 words) ‚Üí `questions-c.json`
  - **C2 Proficiency** (max 90 words) ‚Üí `questions-c.json`

### Step 3: Pick Correct ID
```bash
./getid [a|b|c]  # Get next ID (a=A1/A2, b=B1/B2, c=C1/C2)
[ ! -f "questions/source/q${ID}.json" ] && echo "‚úÖ Available" || echo "‚ùå Exists"
```

### Step 4: Write Individual Question File
Create `questions/source/q{ID}.json` with all mandatory fields, then `node compile-questions.js`


**Mandatory Fields**: `id`, `audioText`, `question`, `questionType`, `options`, `correct`, `explanation`, `difficulty`, `source`, `tags`, `timeCreated`
**Writing Questions**: Add `correctAnswer`, `acceptedAnswers`

## üìù Content Guidelines

### CEFR Word Limits (Strictly Enforced):
- **A1**: Maximum 9 words
- **A2**: Maximum 14 words  
- **B1**: Maximum 25 words
- **B2**: Maximum 38 words
- **C1**: Maximum 60 words
- **C2**: Maximum 90 words

### Question Types:

1. **comprehension**: English question testing understanding
   - Focus on main ideas, details, implications
   - 4 plausible options with clear correct answer

2. **listening**: French "Qu'est-ce que vous avez entendu?"
   - Test exact auditory comprehension
   - Options in French with subtle variations
   - Often paired with comprehension question via `parentQuestion`

3. **fill-in-the-blank**: Missing word completion
   - Question format: "Text with ______ gap"
   - Test vocabulary and grammar knowledge
   - **üö® CRITICAL**: `audioText` must contain complete sentence with correct word, NOT underscores!
   - **Example**: ‚úÖ `"audioText": "Tu aimes cette chose rouge ?"` ‚ùå `"audioText": "Tu ______ cette chose rouge ?"`

4. **writing**: Active vocabulary practice with text input
   - Question format: "Text with ______ gap"
   - User must type the correct French word
   - **üö® CRITICAL**: `audioText` must contain complete sentence with correct word, NOT underscores!
   - **Fields**: `correctAnswer` (primary answer), `acceptedAnswers` (variations including capitalization)
   - **Options**: Empty array `[]`
   - **Correct**: Always `0` (placeholder)
   - **Example**: `"correctAnswer": "mardis"`, `"acceptedAnswers": ["mardis", "Mardis"]`

### Explanation Guidelines:

**üö® CRITICAL: French Translation Requirement**
- **If question and options are in English**: The explanation MUST include the full French translation of the `audioText`
- **Purpose**: Ensures learners understand the French content even when the interface is in English
- **Format**: Include French text followed by " - " and English translation
- **French Text Styling**: All French text in explanations should be italicized using `<em>` tags
- **Example**: ‚úÖ `"The text states '<em>Je mange une pomme rouge</em>' - I am eating a red apple."`

**üö® CRITICAL: Avoid Meta-Commentary in Explanations**
- **Never reference the question bank**: Don't mention what's "missing from our question bank" or "completely missing from our question bank"
- **Never reference coverage analysis**: Don't mention lemma frequency, coverage percentages, or strategic targeting
- **Never reference difficulty levels**: Don't mention "C1-level text", "appropriate for B2 learners", "advanced C2 structure", etc.
- **Focus on the learning**: Explanations should teach the language, not discuss the question creation process or classification system
- **‚ùå FORBIDDEN**: "The adjective 'premier/premi√®re' was completely missing from our question bank despite being very frequent."
- **‚ùå FORBIDDEN**: "This C1-level text discusses complex economic concepts."
- **‚úÖ CORRECT**: "The correct form is 'premi√®re' (first) - feminine form agreeing with 'fois' (time)."

### Tag Guidelines:
Use descriptive, lowercase tags separated by hyphens for **CONTENT TOPICS ONLY**:

**‚úÖ GOOD TAGS (Real-world topics):**
- **Topics**: politics, weather, food, technology, health, business, travel, education
- **Context**: restaurant, workplace, family, news, conversation, formal-situation
- **Content type**: scientific-discussion, casual-chat, media-coverage

**‚ùå FORBIDDEN TAGS (Learning mechanics):**
- **Grammar terms**: listening, comprehension, fill-in-the-blank, conditional, imperfect, subjunctive
- **Verb names**: aller, avoir, √™tre, faire, dire, voir, venir, parler, aimer
- **Individual words**: peu, beaucoup, s√ªr, vrai, beau, seul, heureux, pauvre
- **Language mechanics**: gender-agreement, verb-conjugation, tense-forms, exact-comprehension

**üéØ Core Principle**: Tags describe **WHAT THE SITUATION IS ABOUT** in the real world, not how the French language works.

**Examples**:
- ‚úÖ "restaurant, service, politeness" (real situation)
- ‚ùå "conditional, parler, second-person" (grammar mechanics)

Tags should always be in English and focus on **content themes** that help learners find topics they're interested in.

## üîç Quality Checklist

Before adding a question:
- [ ] Word count within CEFR limits
- [ ] Correct file for difficulty level
- [ ] Unique ID in proper range
- [ ] All mandatory fields present
- [ ] Explanation references specific French phrases
- [ ] **If English question/options: Full French translation included in explanation**
- [ ] **Explanation avoids meta-commentary about question bank, coverage analysis, or difficulty levels**
- [ ] **Tags are CONTENT TOPICS only (no grammar/verb names/individual words)**
- [ ] Options are plausible but only one correct
- [ ] JSON syntax is valid

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools

```bash
./getid [a|b|c]                    # Get next available ID
./questions/source/rq <old> <new>  # Renumber questions safely  
node compile-questions.js          # Compile source files
python3 util/lemma-coverage.py     # Analyze vocabulary gaps
bash util/analyze-questions.sh     # Full question analysis
```

## üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

2. **Don't exceed word limits** - breaks CEFR classification
3. **Don't reuse IDs** - causes conflicts
4. **Don't forget parentQuestion** - for listening variants
5. **üö® CRITICAL: Don't use grammar/verb/word tags** - tags must be real-world content topics only
6. **Don't create implausible distractors** - reduces pedagogical value
7. **Always append the question json files** - don't try to parse and insert in the middle
8. **üö® CRITICAL: Fill-in-the-blank `audioText` must contain complete sentences** - Never use literal underscores `______` in `audioText` field for fill-in-the-blank questions. The `audioText` must contain the complete French sentence with the correct word filled in for proper audio synthesis. Only the `question` field should show blanks to users.
9. **üö® CRITICAL: Writing questions follow same audioText rule** - Like fill-in-the-blank, writing questions must have complete sentences in `audioText` field. The gap (`______`) only appears in the `question` field for user display.
10. **üö® CRITICAL: Writing questions need correctAnswer and acceptedAnswers** - Don't forget to include both `correctAnswer` (primary answer) and `acceptedAnswers` (array with variations) for proper answer validation.
11. **üö® CRITICAL: Avoid proper names in questions** - Never include specific people's names (like "Sophie Bauer", "Marie Dupont", etc.) in questions as they add unnecessary complexity without pedagogical value. Use generic references like "le m√©decin", "la femme", "l'homme", "le professeur" instead.
12. **üö® CRITICAL: Don't include meta-commentary in explanations** - Never reference the question bank, coverage analysis, strategic targeting, or difficulty levels in explanations. Focus on teaching the language, not discussing the question creation process or classification system.
13. **üö® CRITICAL: Level reclassification requires renumbering** - If you change a question's difficulty level (e.g., A2 ‚Üí B1), the question MUST be renumbered to fit the correct ID range. Use `questions/source/rq <old_id> <new_id>` tool to safely renumber questions with automatic Redis data migration and parent question reference updates.
